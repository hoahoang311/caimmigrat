# AWS Amplify Deployment Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved: "Illegal path found for appRoot"

The build error you encountered has been **fixed**. Here's what was corrected:

### 🔧 **What Was Wrong:**
```yaml
# ❌ INCORRECT - Old amplify.yml
version: 1
applications:
  - frontend:
      # ... config
    appRoot: /  # ← This caused the error
```

### 🎯 **What's Fixed:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - New amplify.yml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: out
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
      - .next/cache/**/*
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Deploy:**

1. **Commit the fixes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Amplify configuration - remove illegal appRoot"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or use our deploy script**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh "Fix Amplify configuration"
   ```

3. **In AWS Amplify Console**:
   - If the app exists: It will automatically redeploy with the fixed config
   - If not working: Delete the app and create a new one

## 🔍 **Verification:**

✅ **Local build tested**: `npm run build` creates `out/` directory  
✅ **Static export working**: All pages generated successfully  
✅ **Amplify YAML valid**: Correct frontend configuration  
✅ **No illegal paths**: Removed problematic `appRoot` setting  

## 📁 **Expected Build Output:**

After the fix, Amplify will:
1. Clone your repository ✅
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies ✅  
3. Run `npm run build` to create static files ✅
4. Deploy from `out/` directory ✅
5. Your site will be live! 🎉

## 🆘 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Delete and recreate** the Amplify app
2. **Check Node.js version**: Should be 18+ in Amplify
3. **Review build logs** for any new errors
4. **Contact support** if problems persist

**Your website is now ready for successful deployment!** 🚀
